# Raytracer in C

Trying to write a raytracer from scratch.
It's my first time playing with 2d and 3d image generation.

Image generation is done using pgm.

Can only render planes and circles, but does global and environmental lighting.

Probably switching to c++ and pathtracing instead.

Below is a image generated.
Two links have been added to accommodate cgit and github hosting.
